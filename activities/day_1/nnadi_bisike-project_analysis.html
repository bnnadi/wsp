				<h2>Discovery</h2>
				
				<h3 id="site-intent">Site Intent</h3>
				
				<article>
					<h3>Project Analysis Overview</h3>
					<p>Nadic Engineering needs a website redesign to maintain an internet presence as well as updating their website. There are serveral things that I have found that need to be fixed in this site. All in all this site will receive a complete overhau and revamped for a more modern look and user experience.</p>
				</article>
				
				<article>
					<h3>W3C Validation</h3>
					<p> Nadic Engineering Services website is not W3C compliant in both HTML and CSS. When testing for HTML the site recieved 5 major errors, for instance no DOCTYPE which can lend to rendering problems. A s for CSS the site had 8 errors, imaginary color numbers.</p>
				</article>
				
				<article>
					<h3>Presentation &amp; Content</h3>
					<p>The CSS for their site was written with internal and inline style and as for the HTML it was written in tables. So the website has no seperation of content from presentation and will also make the redesign a little to save any of the conent that they have already.</p>
				</article>
				
				<article>
					<h3>Layout &amp; Structure</h3>
					<p>The current layout for the most part is not bad and it does the job for finding some information. But one thing that I feel needs to be changed other than the look and feel of the website is they usage of space. I plan to only have 6 navigation links and to follow the project requirments.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Logo top left</li>
						<li>Horizontal navigation bar</li>
						<li>Picture slideshow</li>
						<li> 3 columns 
							<ul>
								<li>What's new</li>
								<li>Certifications</li>
								<li>link to apply for employment</li>
							</ul></li>	
					</ul>
